This page briefly explains how to use Caddy to reverse proxy Postiz. A configuration file example is below;

## Example Caddyfile

```caddy Caddyfile
api.postiz.example.lan {
        reverse_proxy * localhost:3000
        tls internal
}

postiz.example.lan {
        reverse_proxy * localhost:4200
        tls internal
}
```

In this example, we have two subdomains: `api.postiz.example.lan` and `postiz.example.lan`. The first one is configured to reverse proxy requests to a service running on `localhost:3000`, while the second one proxies requests to a service running on `localhost:4200`. The `tls internal` directive is used to enable internal TLS for secure communication.

You will need to install the certificate into your browser with this configuration. If you are hosting on a public domain, Caddy allows you to use LetsEncrypt for automatic certificate management. For more information, refer to the [Caddy documentation](https://caddyserver.com/docs/).

## Postiz configuration

To ensure that Postiz works correctly behind a reverse proxy, you may need to adjust its configuration.

```bash
MAIN_URL: "https://postiz.example.lan"
FRONTEND_URL: "https://postiz.example.lan"
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL: "https://api.postiz.example.lan"
```
