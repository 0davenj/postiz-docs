## Docker Compose

This guide assumes that you have docker installed, with a reasonable amount of resources to run Postiz. This Docker Compose setup has been tested with;

- Virtual Machine, Ubuntu 24.04, 4Gb RAM, 2 vCPUs.

<Prereqs />

### Configuration uses environment variables

The docker containers for Postiz are entirely configured with environment variables.

- **Option A** - environment variables in your `docker-compose.yml` file
- **Option B** - environment variables in a `postiz.env` file mounted in `/config` for the Postiz container only
- **Option C** - environment variables in a `.env` file next to your `docker-compose.yml` file (not recommended).

... or a mixture of the above options!

There is a [configuration reference](/configuration/reference/) page with a list
of configuration settings.

## Secure Context required

Postiz marks it's login cookies as Secure, which means you must run it either on localhost, or behind HTTPS - this is called a "secure context". Postiz only supports listening on HTTP, so if you are not using localhost, you will need to use a reverse proxy to handle HTTPS and and be careful to set your URLs accordingly. Documentation on popular reverse proxies can be found in the [reverse proxies](/reverse-proxies/) section, and if you've never used a reverse proxy with docker compose before, then [traefik](/reverse-proxies/traefik/) is recommended.

## Example `docker-compose.yml` file

```yaml
services:
  postiz:
    image: ghcr.io/gitroomhq/postiz-app:latest

    restart: always

## How to use docker compose

Save the file contents to `docker-compose.yml` in your directory you create for postiz.

Run `docker compose up` to start the services.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Note** When you change variables, you must run `docker compose down` and
  then `docker compose up` to recreate these containers with these updated
  variables.
</Callout>

Look through the logs for startup errors, and if you have problems, check out the [support](/support/) page.

If everything looks good, then you can access the Postiz web interface at https://postiz.your-server.com
