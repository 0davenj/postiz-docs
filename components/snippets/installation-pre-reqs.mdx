## Installation Prerequisites

This section will ask you to install & configure several services exaplained below.

### Required Cloud Services

- **[Cloudflare R2](https://cloudflare.com)** - for image uploads and storage.
-- Docs: [How to setup your R2 Bucket](/configuration/r2)
- **Social Media API details** - various API keys and secrets (more details later) for services you want to use; reddit, X, Instagram, etc..

### Optional Cloud Services

- **[Resend account](https://resend.com)** - for user activation and email notifications. If you do not set a `RESEND_API_KEY` variable then new users will be activated automatically. Read more about Resend configuration on the [Resend](/configuration/emails) page.

### Network Requirements

#### Secure Context required (HTTPS)

Postiz marks it's login cookies as Secure, which means you must run it either on localhost, or behind HTTPS -  this is called a "secure context" in modern web browsers.

If you are not running either HTTPS or on loalhost, then you will not be able to login, as your browser will refuse to send the login cookie.

Postiz will not generate your HTTPS certificates for you, and it's servers cannot yet be configured to use a HTTPS certificate. This means you must use a reverse proxy to handle HTTPS. Documentation on popular reverse proxies can be found in the [reverse proxies](/reverse-proxies/) section, and if you've never used a reverse proxy with docker compose before, then [caddy](/reverse-proxies/caddy/) is recommended.

#### Network Ports

- **5000/tcp**: for a single **single entry point** for postiz when running in a container. This is the one port your reverse proxy should talk to.
- **4200/tcp**: for the **Frontend** service (the web interface). 
- **3000/tcp**: for the **Backend** service (the API).
- **5432/tcp**: for the **Postgres** container.
- **6379/tcp**: for the **Redis** container.

If you are installing using docker images, we recommend just exposing port 5000 to your external proxy. This will reduce the likelihood of misconfiguration, and make it easier to manage your network.
