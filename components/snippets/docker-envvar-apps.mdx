## Controlling container services
IF the environment variable `POSTIZ_APPS` is unset, or is an empty string, then all
services will be started in a single container. However, you can only start 
specific services within the docker container by changing this environment variable.

For most deployments, starting all services is fine. To scale out, you might want
to start individual containers for "frontend", "backend", "worker" and "cron".
